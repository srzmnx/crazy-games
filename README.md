# crazy-games
### this is crazy games, an archived project which i started back in 2023. it's original premise was to well, be a game site. have fun and stuff. but my admin blocked everything. i lost all access to hosting services, i had no longer had ability to use github (github wasnt even allowed in my county btw i had other services.) but then, i found a site named codeberg. codeberg was basically a 1:1 copy of github but different in it's own ways. differences include the automatic creation of a page and such. anyway, i used this to make my first site, sorta games. this got a LOT of attention. i had a friend (undisclosed) to add a password to this site so only the two of us could use it. eventually somebody saw the password somewhere and spread it everywhere. it was like.. a hivemind. horrible. it scared me. so you know what i did? I DELETED IT ALL. everything, gone. and i wasnt even sorry. meanwhile, another person at my school who had made a game site had gotten attacked for not letting others use it. after the next school year came to be, i revived crazy games but added a monitor on it (remotejs) so i could see what users were doing. (and if there were one too many i'd just redirect them somewhere.) eventually, codeberg finally came to be blocked by our administrator, leaving the end of hosting sites, forever. i have left this project here for you, do what you want with it. fork it! show it to your friends! do whatever the hell you want, i dont care lol.
